#Simpledown

Simple down is a clean and simple markdown editor for the web. 

You can read more about why I built this [here](https://medium.com/@SnazzyHam/750e5663bb1f).

Simpledown was built based off an example for Vue.js, and features Marked.js and Solid. 


Upcoming features
- Save to Dropbox
- Import local file (maybe?)
- Export HTML (maybe?)

My goal for Simpledown is to be a place you can easily just get to and start writing. No logins, no syncing, no backend. If that is something you want, I would recommend [Draft](http://draftin.com).
